    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>Let us initialize a value, but we can change it along the code advance</p>
    <h2>Constants</h2>
    <p>They are defined once and they will never change again, otherwise, we would have an error</p>
    <p>An example of a constant is the PI number, that is <?php echo PI; ?></p>
    <p>Anyways, we can have a string as a constant too, for example my name will never change, this is <?php echo NAME; ?></p>
